This site remains open for donations, but here is the epilogue to the episodic journal we somehow managed to post every day during our ride.
Wheel Dipped and Job Done
Wheel Dipped and Job Done
August 7th, Day 50: At noon today we dipped Genevieve’s front wheel in the Atlantic.
A Buxom Lass Clears Her Throat

August 6th, Day 49: It’s never over until the fat lady sings, but I do believe I heard a buxom lass clearing her throat this afternoon in a preparatory sort of way.
A Small Institutional Paradox

August 5th, Day 48: Although we only have 2 days of riding left, today was the first seriously hilly one for the new boy Owers
The Accessibility Dance with Technology

August 4th, Day 47: We’re counting down the days to the Atlantic...
And Your Name Is...?
And Your Name Is...?
August 3rd, Day 46: As we progress east through upstate New York, the terrain is changing quite rapidly in line with our progress into New England
Mechanicals come in 3s
Mechanicals come in 3s
August 2nd, Day 45: We started today on only 3 cylinders due to the front left malfunction as reported in yesterday's post.
Artisanal Allure

August 1st, Day 44: Today’s ride was pleasant and fast...But James is developing a slightly worrying pain in his left thigh.

Niagara to Namibia
July 31st, Day 43: Today on our rest day in Niagara we were particularly pleased to see that the Quality Inn has very much embraced our mission.
Recipe for a Fast Ride

July 30th, Day 42: Take a medium sized stoker...
The Poverty of Language

July 29th, Day 41: Today was a Flatterday Saturday.
Canada

July 28th, Day 40: Canada, Oh Canada, Where The Air Is Sweet, The Dogs Don’t Bite and They Actually Maintain The Roads
The Abomination of Budget Chain Cuisine
The Abomination of Budget Chain Cuisine
July 27th, Day 39: Today we rode 88 miles to reach the Canadian border at Port Huron on our second great lake

On the Kindness of Hills
July 26th, Day 38: Today’s ride was as flat as it gets, but the headwind was relentless. Fortunately we caught a ride on the Davey Train and with some great teamwork managed to average 18.8mph.
Welcome to Michigan
Welcome to Michigan
July 25th, Day 37: As we disembarked from the ferry crossing of Lake Michigan yesterday evening we entered Michigan, our 7th state of the transamerica ride
Pain Management

July 24th, Day 36: Today we are on a 4 hour ferry crossing of Lake Michigan.
A Bit More On Scale
A Bit More On Scale
July 23rd, Day 35: A couple of things today have reminded me that I haven’t been banging on much recently about the sheer scale of things in the US.
Speed Dating for Tandem Partners
Speed Dating for Tandem Partners
July 22nd, Day 34: I am incredibly indebted to my great friend, John Rigg, for indirectly finding both of my tandem pilots.
Eddington Numbers and Extraordinary Cycling Records
Eddington Numbers and Extraordinary Cycling Records
July 21st, Day 33: The last 50 miles of today’s ride was in the sort of constant rain that makes one think of England (not necessarily in a homesick sort of way). But at least it wasn’t cold and the winds weren’t fierce.
The Other Side Of The Coin
The Other Side Of The Coin
July 20th, Day 32: Despite what might have been the steepest sustained climb on the ride so far, today was kind to us. There were enough rolling ups and downs for Genevieve to really stretch her legs and after 87 miles we were in time for lunch on the hotel terrace in La Crosse overlooking the Mississippi, just over the border into Wisconsin.
Delusions of Normality
Delusions of Normality
July 19th, Day 31: After a slight diversion due to construction work, today just tipped over into being our second consecutive century. But with relentless headwinds, many miles of bone rattling road surfaces and what felt like much more than 2,050 ft of climbing, it certainly felt like a tough one.
What Made Me Who I Am
What Made Me Who I Am
July 18th, Day 30: For the first time since Day 0 it actually rained during today’s ride for 30 minutes or so. It was a long slog, albeit marginally downhill, giving Chris time to muse a little about what made him who he is.
Goodbye Alastair, Hello Minnesota
Goodbye Alastair, Hello Minnesota
July 17th, Day 29: Yesterday evening our disgraced co-author, Mr Heggie, picked him self up and set out on his new career as a roving reporter. His first mission was to investigate public transport in rural America by taking the overnight Greyhound from Sioux Falls to Chicago. In the meantime, James Owers has stepped seamlessly into Heggie’s shoes and navigated Genevieve flawlessly.
The Regrettable But Necessary Dismissal of my Co-author
The Regrettable But Necessary Dismissal of my Co-author
July 16th, Day 28: Goodbye to Alastair, and hello to James. We marked this arrival of fresh horses by dipping the front wheel for Alastair and the rear wheel for James.
Dew Point
Dew Point
July 15th, Day 27: Today we had blessed relief from the Winds of South Dakota, to the extent that our average speed came back to 17mph, and we were ready for an Adult Beverage at lunch time, without feeling like we’d have to crawl into the bar let alone out of it.
Puk U, Winds Of South Dakota
Puk U, Winds Of South Dakota
July 14th, Day 26: There were several entertaining diversions available on this 71 mile leg. But I have to report rather sheepishly our lack of touristic engagement with these attractions.
Two massive milestones, one long day and one short post
Two massive milestones, one long day and one short post
July 13th, Day 25: Today we completed the first half of the Transamerica ride. And more importantly, we blew past our fundraising target of £108,000.
Look, Learn And Be Happy, For Tomorrow We Ride
Look, Learn And Be Happy, For Tomorrow We Ride
July 12th, Day 24: The Badlands is such an unusual and striking landscape that we chose to dedicate this post to our serious minded reader who has persevered in the hope that this blog might say something vaguely educational.
A Short Dictionary of Circumlocution
A Short Dictionary of Circumlocution
Jul 11th, Day 23: Today I was prompted me to write up a few of the more interesting circumlocutions we’ve encountered on our journey.
What Makes A Transamerica Ride Harder If You’re Blind?
What Makes A Transamerica Ride Harder If You’re Blind?
July 10th, Day 22: This is a question I have been musing about over the past 3 weeks, prompted by the massive generosity of many people, both in terms of their donations and their words.
Hints and Tips For Long Distance Riding
Hints and Tips For Long Distance Riding
Jul 9th, Day 21: Today we added a fourth state to our states-visited list and encountered a man of the law. We also present our refined approach for getting to each day's destination hotel as painlessly as possible.
Another one for the geeks
Another one for the geeks
July 8th, Day 20: Exciting news: We have updated our Route and Tracker page to include ride statistics from the Garmin GPS for the rides done so far. We also received an email from Nick East, proving that at least some of our readers are as geeky as us.
Final Fund Raising Push – Just Passed £100k
Final Fund Raising Push – Just Passed £100k
Jul 7th, Day 19: Today was our second rest day, spent mostly cleaning, repairing or replacing bike parts and body parts. It was also a massive fund raising milestone as we just passed the £100,000 mark.
The Nearest Thing To Civilisation
The Nearest Thing To Civilisation
July 6th, Day 18: The most interesting thing about today’s 119 mile ride was the almost entire lack of anything visually interesting. I know this because at least 20 people told me I wasn’t missing much.
Getting To Know Wyoming
Getting To Know Wyoming
July 5th Day 17: Today we recorded what will probably be the fastest 80 mile ride in my life, averaging 21.5mph

"It’s All Downhill From Here"
July 4th, Day 16: “It’s All Downhill from here” is an apposite observation regarding: the average age of our group of co-riders; our crossing of the Continental Divide today; and our stunningly fast 28 mile ride from the top of the pass to our hotel in Dubois.
A Day of Firsts
A Day of Firsts
July 3rd, Day 15: Today was always going to be a tough one. 91 miles with 5,700ft of climbing, including doing the last 3 miles up the Teton pass to 8,400ft in our lowest available gear.
Mairs-Heggie Points
Mairs-Heggie Points
July 2nd, Day 14: Both our regular readers will remember that we mentioned the Mairs Heggie sequence a few days ago. This is a fascinating (to us), but entirely useless mathematical construct pertaining to multi-day journeys.
More Problems With The Rear End
More Problems With The Rear End
July 1st, Day 13: Our own inevitable rear end issues can be fixed, or at least mitigated, by liberal application of chamois cream. Sadly, Genevieve is not so easily cured, although, at least in principle, her rear end is more replaceable than my own.
Team GB – The Empire Strikes Back
Team GB – The Empire Strikes Back
June 30th, Day 12: In these dangerous Brexit times this wasn’t perhaps the most politically sensitive name to choose for our team in today’s Scavenger Hunt (aka treasure hunt).
97 miles before lunch, but didn’t see much (Alastair as well as me)
97 miles before lunch, but didn’t see much (Alastair as well as me)
June 29th, day 11: Today we rode 97 miles and are now at 3,500 ft in Twin Falls, Idaho. This small town has two claims to fame...
The Poorliness of the Long Distance Cyclist
The Poorliness of the Long Distance Cyclist
28th June, Day 10: Our last post mentioned the masochistic element of cycling. Reasoning that a problem shared is a problem halved we thought it would be beneficial to treat our readers to some more detail on the many ailments that affect the long distance cyclist.
Fly-over Fusion and our new rogues  gallery
Fly-over Fusion and our new rogues gallery
June 27: Day 9: On our first rest day we are writing this blog outside Bar Gernika in the Basque region of Boise and we’ve just started a page for photos of our co-riders.
Wake up and smell the onions
Wake up and smell the onions
26th June, Day 8: It's been a relief to arrive in a modest metropolis for some well deserved rest and recuperation. By comparison, our starting point of Ontario, OR, seems to be notable mainly for an overpowering odor of onions in the surrounding rural areas.
One state down, nine to go
One state down, nine to go
25th June, Day 7: After riding 507 miles in 7 days across Oregon, we have just reached the state border with Idaho.
Mamils and Diversity of the Species
Mamils and Diversity of the Species
24 June, Day 6: It’s not strictly true that this is a ride purely for Mamils, but the point still stands that the group are (with a couple of exceptions) certainly not spring chickens and are all clad in Lycra on expensive bikes.
Some geeky Stats From Today’s Ride
Some geeky Stats From Today’s Ride
23rd June, Day 5: I promise not to fill this blog with geeky stats about average speed, max speed, calories burned and so forth, but from now on we will put the date, day number, start and end points plus mileage and feet of ascent right at the top of each post
Shorter, Snappier and More Amusing
Shorter, Snappier and More Amusing
22nd June, Day 4: I recall a journalist friend once bemoaning to me over a beer that her latest submission to her editor had been returned with no annotation other than scrawled at the top ‘Needs to be shorter, snappier and more amusing’. I am now somewhat paranoid.
A Question Of Scale
A Question Of Scale
21st June, Day 3: At one level we all know that the US is just shed loads bigger than the UK. But there’s something about cycling through the landscape that really brings this home.
Welches N., pl.: people who default on an obligation, especially a small one
Welches N., pl.: people who default on an obligation, especially a small one
20th June, Day 2: This dictionary definition seems extremely harsh for the end point for today’s ride. The residents are just as hospitable and genuine as all the other inhabitants of Oregon that we’ve had the pleasure to meet.
1 Down, 49 to Go
1 Down, 49 to Go
19th June, Day 1: After yesterday’s short 26 mile round trip to the ocean, and 3 hours of briefings, we set off today on the first leg of the Transamerica route.
What Lies Ahead
What Lies Ahead
After accidentally dipping all four of our feet in the Pacific while undertaking the obligatory rear wheel dip, Alastair and I distracted ourselves by thinking about what stats we will accumulate before we next get our feet wet in the ocean.
Almost Half Way
A somewhat confusing post entry for anyone who read yesterday’s post saying that we were past half way on the funding and not even started on the riding....
Funds Half Done, And The Ride Begins
Yesterday we hit a major fund raising milestone, crossing the half way line towards our £108,000 target. That means we have already funded more than 1,800 sight restorations.
Our schedule
We depart from Astoria, Oregon on June 18th, beginning with a ritual dip of our rear wheel in the Pacific Ocean. If all goes to plan we will arrive in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, after crossing 9 states, on August 7th to complete the complementary ritual of a front wheel dip in the Atlantic Ocean.
