It is now exactly 2 months since we flew to Astoria to commence the journey on the Pacific coast, and one week since we dipped Genevieve&rsquo;s front wheel in the Atlantic. So here are a few short reflections on two of the more memorable months of my life.
Observation 1: the daily routine was so unrelenting that it is already hard to put events in sequence and/or remember what happened where. But I am sure that over the coming weeks, months and years, I will bore the pants off friends who were not there with seemingly trivial or unremarkable reminiscences. Perhaps the experience has to be consumed in its entirety to be fully appreciated. Note to self: refrain from future dissing of Wagner until I&rsquo;ve sat through the entire Ring Cycle at least once. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

At noon today we dipped Genevieve&rsquo;s front wheel in the Atlantic. We also ceremonially topped up the Atlantic with a bottle of seawater that the group had carried all the way from the Pacific. We engaged in some emotional mutual congratulations with many of the other riders and I can categorically say this was the first time I have ever hugged a judge.






Chris and James dip Genevieve's front wheel in the Atlantic at Portsmouth, NH



I don&rsquo;t yet feel ready to reflect on the experiences of the past 7 weeks, but I do want to say a few heartfelt thank yous:

To the America By Bicycle staff for shepherding us across this vast continent
To Genevieve for being such a trusty and willing mount
To James and Alastair for being the most brilliant pilots and gentleman&rsquo;s gentlemen I could imagine

It&rsquo;s never over until the fat lady sings, but I do believe I heard a buxom lass clearing her throat this afternoon in a preparatory sort of way. After entering our 10th&nbsp;and final state this morning, we had another day of reasonably stiff climbing. James&rsquo; thigh is definitely on the mend and we averaged 14.5 mph over the 78 mile ride. This leaves just 60 miles tomorrow until we dip our front wheel in the Atlantic.






James and Chris were delighted with the sunny welcome to New Hampshire



So&nbsp;how much of North America&nbsp;have we actually seen&nbsp;on this 3,653 mile journey?&nbsp;The literal answer of course in my case is zero. Even in the case of the other riders it is a tiny, tiny amount. We have crossed the entire continent, and the horizon on both sides has sometimes looked an awfully long way away, albeit only separated from us by one ginormous cornfield. But ... ]]></description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Aug 2017 19:25:17 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[ A Small Institutional Paradox ]]></title><link><![CDATA[ https://www.alineofsight.org.uk/Blog/a-small-institutional-paradox ]]></link><guid isPermaLink="true"><![CDATA[ https://www.alineofsight.org.uk/Blog/a-small-institutional-paradox ]]></guid><description><![CDATA[ August 5th, Day 48: Latham, NY to Brattleboro, VT: 79 miles, 5080&nbsp;ft. ascent
Although we only have 2 days of riding left, today was the first seriously hilly one for the new boy Owers. We are pleased to report that despite worries about his left thigh&nbsp;he acquitted himself commendably. Without any silliness we pushed through the 79 miles and 5080 ft of ascent at 12.5 mph. We were rewarded at one point on top of Hogback Mountain by views into 4 separate states &ndash; Vermont, New Hampshire, New York and Massachusetts.







James and Chris take it in turns to look gormless against the beautiful backdrop of Hogback Mountain



As we near the end of the ride, many of us are wondering how we will cope back in the real world without the institutional regime of a Transamerica ride. Some of the group are planning to continue riding on a daily basis. Others are planning on throwing their bikes into the Atlantic, but nonetheless initiating hourly calorific refreshment br... ]]></description><pubDate>Sat, 05 Aug 2017 21:58:57 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[ The Accessibility Dance with Technology ]]></title><link><![CDATA[ https://www.alineofsight.org.uk/Blog/the-accessibility-dance-with-technology ]]></link><guid isPermaLink="true"><![CDATA[ https://www.alineofsight.org.uk/Blog/the-accessibility-dance-with-technology ]]></guid><description><![CDATA[ August 4th, Day 47: Little Falls, NY to Latham, NY: 75 miles, 2060 ft. ascent
We&rsquo;re counting down the days to the Atlantic, with only 3 left now. After a careful day&rsquo;s riding we&rsquo;re a bit more optimistic that the front left cylinder&nbsp;may not blow a head gasket on tomorrow&rsquo;s hills. But we&rsquo;re definitely crossing all available digits and digging deep into our supply of lotions and potions.

Bumbling along at 12.7 mph today, I reflected on the&nbsp;special technology I use&nbsp;to do&nbsp;my job,&nbsp;to&nbsp;engage with the world around me and&nbsp;to&nbsp;ride the bike.
The Job
For my job I rely incredibly heavily on email, which is pretty accessible using a speech synthesis screen reader on my laptop or my phone. I would&nbsp;presumably&nbsp;prefer to use more current technologies like Slack, Trello, Google Docs and so on. But sadly, blind accessibility features are almost invaria... ]]></description><pubDate>Fri, 04 Aug 2017 19:15:08 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[ And Your Name Is...? ]]></title><link><![CDATA[ https://www.alineofsight.org.uk/Blog/and-your-name-is ]]></link><guid isPermaLink="true"><![CDATA[ https://www.alineofsight.org.uk/Blog/and-your-name-is ]]></guid><description><![CDATA[ August 3rd, Day 46: Syracuse, NY to Little Falls, NY: 80 miles, 1334 ft. ascent
As we progress East through upstate New York, the terrain is changing quite rapidly in line with our progress towards&nbsp;New England. James described Little Falls&nbsp;as somewhat reminiscent of a small northern industrial town (in a good sort of way). We have hills again and the roadkill has changed from predominantly deer and raccoons to turtles and beavers (there&rsquo;s a lot of water around here).






James and Chris roll into Little Falls 'three-legged', tailed closely by Dirk



We continued to take it easy today in the hope that James' thigh will miraculously recover before Saturday&rsquo;s climbing if we treat it nicely until then. We averaged 14.2 mph for the ride and got a chance to talk with a different subset of the group as we rode along.
It&rsquo;s surprising how good I have now got at recognising the voices of the 35 or so remaining riders over the past 7 weeks, despite all ... ]]></description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Oct 2017 14:04:41 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[ Mechanicals come in 3s ]]></title><link><![CDATA[ https://www.alineofsight.org.uk/Blog/mechanicals-come-in-3s ]]></link><guid isPermaLink="true"><![CDATA[ https://www.alineofsight.org.uk/Blog/mechanicals-come-in-3s ]]></guid><description><![CDATA[ August 2nd, Day 45: Rochester, NY to Syracuse, NY: 92 miles, 1274 ft. ascent
We started today on only 3 cylinders due to the front left malfunction as reported in yesterday's post.






James takes all the British support he can get for the front left cylinder



 Consequently we chose to take a leisurely ride with fingers crossed that drugs, ice, heat and James&rsquo; youthful physique will be sufficient for rapid recovery (complete rest and leg elevation both sadly a tad tricky on a 92 mile bike ride).
This strategy seems at least good enough to get us through the next 2 days with similar terrain, judging by the score below 2 on the Pain Register throughout the ride and the absence of swearing from up front. The big test will be in 3 days time when we hit the serious hills in Vermont.
The other two mechanicals were more readily fixable &ndash; 2 separate back wheel punctures within 2 hours.

Today&rsquo;s ride was pleasant and fast. Good roads, a slight tail wind and not too many hills. So we rattled along at 18.4 mph. But James is developing a slightly worrying pain in his left thigh. He spent the final 2 hours of the ride calling a score between 6 and 8 on the Pain Register, interspersed with the sort of swearing you&rsquo;d expect from a bunch of sailors not an aspiring academic.
Now we are back in our room he is being a typical man, saying it will all be fine in the morning. Meanwhile, I&rsquo;m trying to do a passable impression of my wife, expressing concern and sympathy, while suggesting sensible things like heat, ice, anti-inflammatory drugs and gentle massage. Although I think I&rsquo;m getting most of the words right, there&rsquo;s something slightly off-key in the tone of voice; probably because my inner man is just dying to agree with James that it&rsquo;ll be fine in the morning... ]]></description><pubDate>Tue, 01 Aug 2017 21:05:21 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[ Niagara to Namibia ]]></title><link><![CDATA[ https://www.alineofsight.org.uk/Blog/niagara-to-namibia ]]></link><guid isPermaLink="true"><![CDATA[ https://www.alineofsight.org.uk/Blog/niagara-to-namibia ]]></guid><description><![CDATA[ July 31st, Day 43: Rest Day.

We took the obligatory trip on the Maid of the Mist, and mostly observed the materialistic excesses of Niagara tourism, including casinos, helicopters and enough ice cream to fill several Olympic sized swimming pools.

 Speaking of Olympic swimming pools, here&rsquo;s today&rsquo;s trivia fact: The water flowing over the US and Canadian falls at Niagara every day would fill approximately 86,000 Olympic swimming pools. Put another way, if the falls were cascading Guinness not water they would deliver around 1 billion calories per second&hellip;. So that&rsquo;ll be about one reasonably large buffet breakfast every second. &nbsp;

Take a medium sized stoker.
Remove all excess fat. This can be a lengthy and tedious process but it is well worth the effort. It is, however, worth leaving the small fatty deposits at the junction of the haunches as stripping these right back can release bile that may ruin the subsequent meal entirely.
Tenderize the rump well. One recommended implement for this step is the Brooks Saddle - see the Heggie description here, starting at around 4:50.
Stuff the stoker with as much banana and raisins as possible and moisturise well with Gatorade (most of this will evaporate over the next 4 hours, so make sure to keep topping up).
Glaze liberally with suncream.
Bake for 4 hours under a moderate sun in a fan assisted, constant pressure paceline (the Davey Train works particularly well).
Do not deviate from instructions provided by the GPS unit as this&nbsp;could result in overcooking. It&nbsp;can also,... ]]></description><pubDate>Sun, 30 Jul 2017 19:55:27 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[ The Poverty of Language ]]></title><link><![CDATA[ https://www.alineofsight.org.uk/Blog/the-poverty-of-language ]]></link><guid isPermaLink="true"><![CDATA[ https://www.alineofsight.org.uk/Blog/the-poverty-of-language ]]></guid><description><![CDATA[ July 29th, Day 41: London, Ontario to Brantford, Ontario: 70 miles, 799 ft. ascent
Today was a Flatterday Saturday. Although we had headwinds again (!) they were nowhere near as soul destroying as yesterday, and we managed to hook on to the Davey Train once more, so knocked out the 70 miles at 17.4 mph to be at Brantford by 12.15 in time for a relaxed lunch with adult beverage on the hotel terrace.&nbsp;
On extended trips like this one there are many opportunities for people to describe scenery to me. This proves to be an incredibly difficult thing to do. It&rsquo;s relatively straightforward to describe what the scenery actually is, but much harder to describe why it is beautiful or to differentiate it from other&nbsp;notionally&nbsp;similar scenery.
This problem was wonderfully illustrated by my co-rider on a Lands End To John o&rsquo;Groats ride back in 2012.

Canada, Oh Canada, Where The Air Is Sweet, The Dogs Don&rsquo;t Bite and They Actually Maintain The Roads.

Today we rode 88 miles to reach the Canadian border at Port Huron on our second great lake.&nbsp;Easy terrain and no significant wind, so aside from the awful bone rattling road surfaces this felt like an active recovery day. We must be getting fitter because we&rsquo;re feeling reasonably fresh despite averaging&nbsp;17.4&nbsp;mph.
I am&nbsp;now only 11 days&nbsp;from the end of a quite epic&nbsp;50 day&nbsp;challenge. Specifically, the challenge of eating budget chain meals for breakfast lunch and dinner for 50 consecutive days without&nbsp;calling Hughie on the porcelain telephone,&nbsp;and without being ejected from the premises for expressing an overly frank opinion (although James did have to caution me to simmer down at Wendy&rsquo;s a couple of nights ago).

Today&rsquo;s ride was as flat as it gets, but the headwind was relentless. Fortunately we caught a ride on the Davey Train and with some great teamwork managed to average 18.8 mph.

To provide a bit of contrast with such a flat ride here are some thoughts on hills I prepared earlier.
I&nbsp;have&nbsp;now&nbsp;spent&nbsp;over&nbsp;5 weeks doing very little except cycling,&nbsp;preparing for cycling, repairing after cycling,&nbsp;blogging about cycling, dreaming about cycling and (increasingly)&nbsp;fantasising&nbsp;about not cycling.
This&nbsp;has provided&nbsp;ample time and ample empirical evidence for formulating some unscientific theories about what makes hills cruel and what makes hills kind.
But before getting into the geeky stuff, here&rsquo;s a novel piece of stoker abuse.

As we disembarked from the ferry crossing of Lake Michigan yesterday evening we entered Michigan, our 7th&nbsp;state of the transamerica ride and also entered Eastern Daylight Time &ndash; i.e. the timezone that we will be on for the rest of the journey.

It really is starting to feel as though we have broken the back of this journey now, although with 2,719 miles done, we still have 934 miles to go. And that remaining 934 miles is still slightly longer than the standard Lands End to John o&rsquo;Groats End To End ride across the UK.
Today&rsquo;s 112 mile ride was our last century of the journey. It felt quite hard with lots of rollers and a not particularly friendly wind. So we were reasonably content to average 15.7 mph.

Today we are on a 4 hour ferry crossing of Lake Michigan. The Internet service on the boat is apparently so poor as to make the hotels we&rsquo;ve been staying in feel as though they are at the very forefront of the digital revolution (in reality the hotel connectivity has on many days been worse than the 19.2kbps modem I had at home 20 years ago). Anyway, rather more constructively, I thought I&rsquo;d rattle this off before breakfast so James can post before we leave the hotel.
After spending 2,500 miles in the saddle I&rsquo;ve had a certain amount of time to develop coping strategies for dealing with self inflicted pain. James has been working on a hypothesis around the optimum pedalling speed to minimise total pain integrated over time. Sadly his preliminary draft did not pass the exacting peer review standards for this publication so here&rsquo;s something less scientific while he refines his thesis.&nbsp;

A couple of things today have reminded me that I haven&rsquo;t been banging on much recently about the sheer scale of things in the US. It maybe that I&rsquo;m starting to take it for granted or it may simply be that I have been distracted by the dismissal of Heggie and the induction of Owers. But fortunately the new boy seems to have got the general gist of what he needs to do now, judging by the fact we averaged 17.9 mph today, and it was actually him hustling me to do less faffing at the refreshment stop rather than vice versa.
The first thing that reminded me of scale was an enforced stop for most of the group for 10 minutes while a 200 car freight train crossed the road, accompanied by iconic sounds of hooting, clanking and ringing bells.

James used to work with John, who introduced him to me 4 years ago to pilot Genevieve on a 100 km charity night ride around London. I had not seen James since then as he has been up in Edinburgh pursuing his PhD in Machine Learning. However, when I mentioned the 60x60@60 concept&nbsp;to John he immediately suggested James as a candidate pilot. Although James was keen to take the front seat, he could only do half the ride. But he instantly solved the other half of the problem by proposing that his close friend Alastair Heggie take the first half of the journey. I had never met Alastair and he had never ridden a tandem, but as most of the group will testify, he is, like James, a strong and safe rider (and a reasonably quick learner).

The last 50 miles of today&rsquo;s ride was in the sort of constant rain that makes one think of England (not necessarily in a homesick sort of way). But at least it wasn&rsquo;t cold and the winds weren&rsquo;t fierce.
The combination of the rain and the short, sharp hills reminded me of my regular Sunday rides with Bath CTC, and in particular a recent conversation with Michael Perryman. &nbsp;
As Michael is an astronomy professor, he is great to cycle with if you ever feel like a mental workout to match the physical one. Like me, he is a fan of numerical elegance and introduced me to the concept of the Eddington Number.
Eddington numbers are perhaps best explained by an example: if you have an Eddington number of 95 then you have ridden at least 95 rides that are at least 95 miles long.

Despite what might have been the steepest sustained climb on the ride so far, today was kind to us. There were enough rolling ups and downs for Genevieve to really stretch her legs and after 87 miles we were in time for lunch on the hotel terrace in La Crosse overlooking the Mississippi, just over the border into Wisconsin.

For the past 3 days we have been travelling through industrial scale livestock farming country, so there is very little visual to report. I am actually on an equal footing to everyone else regarding the major sensory input in these parts. Unpleasantly, that&rsquo;s because the most noticeable thing around here is the smell of the Swine Express trucks and the processing plants they are supplying. Not nice.

For the first time since Day 0 it actually rained during today&rsquo;s ride for 30 minutes or so. We did get drenched but I made a conscious decision not to wear a rain jacket to avoid that delightful boil in the bag effect brought on by wearing waterproof garments on a hot and humid day.
Despite the rain and a short break to let the thunderstorms move away, we made good progress and averaged 17.1 mph for the 112 miles.
The rest of this post is entirely unrelated to America, cycling or rain, but it does focus on blindness, the condition at the very heart of this endeavour for me. This below&nbsp;is a bit less frivolous than most entries in this journal, but some of you might find it insightful.

Yesterday evening our disgraced co-author, Mr Heggie, picked him self up and set out on his new career as a roving reporter. His first mission was to investigate public transport in rural America by taking the overnight Greyhound from Sioux Falls to Chicago.






Ali jumps in a cab to the Greyhound - "Yo homes, to Bel-Air!"



In the meantime, James Owers&nbsp;has stepped seamlessly into Heggie&rsquo;s shoes and navigated Genevieve flawlessly through our 70 mile ride to Worthington, MN at 15.7 mph. Shortly after the town of Brandon, where James had made creative use of the sidewalk to avoid some unpleasant traffic, a patrol car pulled up ahead of us. Fortunately we had just crossed the state border and the officer was only interested in snapping photos of Genevieve and her two unlikely riders passing through his patch, which did not of course include Brandon.

On this rest day in Sioux Falls, we announce with a heavy heart the termination of Mr A. Heggie&rsquo;s appointment as co-author of this compendium of nonsense and bullshit. Unfortunately Mr Heggie&rsquo;s credibility has become irreparably damaged after he convinced a co-rider at yesterday&rsquo;s refreshment stop to consume a gherkin liberally smothered in chocolate paste on the grounds this is a British delicacy.
However, the excellent news is that we already have a replacement, also from Edinburgh, so please welcome Mr James Owers.
As well as taking on this vital journalistic role, Mr Owers will also be taking over from the disgraced Heggie as co-rider of Genevieve for the second half of the Transamerica ride.

Today we had blessed relief from the Winds of South Dakota, to the extent that our average speed came back to 17mph, and we were ready for an Adult Beverage at lunch time, without feeling like we&rsquo;d have to crawl into the bar let alone out of it.
There were no world famous tourist attractions between Mitchell and Sioux Falls, so we&rsquo;ve just posted a few pleasing photos from our co-riders below with no particular theme.
But it did start getting humid today which reminded us we need to post on the concept of Dew Point. Right from the start of the ride, this has been something that people have regularly alluded to in the confident sort of voice that brooks no interrogation of what they actually mean. It turns out that most people&rsquo;s knowledge is limited to &nbsp;&lsquo;High Dew Point Bad, Low Dew Point Good&rsquo;, although Alastair seems to have a mental block on even this basic point.

There were several entertaining diversions available on this 72 mile leg. But I have to report rather sheepishly that Alastair and I did not experience the Tractor Museum of Kimball, we did not experience the lawn mower race track of Pukwana we did not experience the Corn Palace of Mitchell, and we did not even experience the Puk U bar. But boy, did we experience the winds of South Dakota &ndash; again!

Our decision to bypass the Puk U bar seems rational as there is a strict moratorium on adult beverages while riding and it was still before 9am. But our lack of touristic engagement with the rest of these attractions (surpassed in the annals of world tourism only by Wall Drug) can only be explained by our single minded determination to thwart the once again unremitting winds. Our focus was somewhat undermined by the locals, who dismissed the wind as little more than a breeze.

Tomorrow&rsquo;s 114 Mile ride is Alastair&rsquo;s last century before I get fresh horses (aka James Owers) at Sioux Falls. Which makes it almost exactly as long as yesterday's ride and today put together.
So our 57 mile ride today was definitely another one billed as &lsquo;active recovery'. We took the opportunity to enjoy it very much, spending more than half the ride in The Badlands National Park. This was a very special place to be while the air was still cool and fresh after last night&rsquo;s rain and while there was no traffic to be seen or heard (hurrah, hurrah!).
The Badlands is such an unusual and striking landscape that we chose to dedicate this post to our serious minded reader. That is to say, the one who has persevered until now in the heretofor forlorn hope that this blog might not be entirely content free.

Today&rsquo;s 57 mile ride was what the tour organisers call an &lsquo;active recovery day&rsquo;, and today we actually agreed with them. Not sure if that means we&rsquo;re getting fitter or if it really was a very easy day. There was a certain amount of excitement when we rode through a bush fire that seemed to be getting out of control. Vegetation on both sides of the road was on fire and there was a lot of smoke and heat. Shortly after we went through we saw and heard several fire trucks converging on the scene.&nbsp;
Today we are in Wall, and although the penultimate entry in the list below doesn&rsquo;t actually count as circumlocution (it&rsquo;s just outrageous marketing bullshit by Wall Drug), it did nonetheless prompt me to write up a few of the more interesting circumlocutions we&rsquo;ve encountered.

This is a question I have been musing about over the past 3 weeks, prompted by the massive generosity of many people, both in terms of their donations and their words.
My ultimate conclusion is that it isn&rsquo;t actually any harder, it&rsquo;s just differently hard.
There&rsquo;s an obvious initial logistical/management challenge of signing up one or more co-riders who will not just take responsibility on the bike, but also help with all the frustrating little things like buffet breakfasts, finding the hotel room, maintaining the bike, guiding to adult beverage emporia, etc. But after entrapping appropriate co-riders, which I seem to have managed miraculously well, things suddenly become pretty easy.

Over the past 3 weeks we&rsquo;ve been refining our approach to each day&rsquo;s task of getting to the next hotel as painlessly as possible.

Exciting news: We have updated our Route and Tracker page to include ride statistics from the Garmin GPS for the rides done so far.
From this we can calculate that our average speed over the whole ride so far (excluding parts where the Garmin malfunctioned) is a bit under 15 and a half miles per hour.
We've also started adding links to some great videos automatically generated from our GPS data by Relive,&nbsp;like this one of us crossing the Togwotee pass.
Today we were pleased to ride another 6 hour century on the first day of the third segment of our ride. However, we were even more pleased to receive an email from Nick East on the subject of Mairs-Heggie points, proving that at least some of our readers are as geeky as us.

The most interesting thing about today&rsquo;s 119 mile ride was the almost entire lack of anything visually interesting. I know this because at least 20 people told me I wasn&rsquo;t missing much.
Sadly, contemplating the sheer enormity of the nothingness was punctuated every 15 seconds or so by someone racing past at 80mph in a desperate bid to reach something approaching civilization in Casper.
I&rsquo;m reminded of an incident on our Land&rsquo;s End &ndash; John o&rsquo;Groats end to end across the UK in 2012. We had missed our rendezvous with our support vehicle for lunch and were struggling through driving wind and rain across the Forest of Bowland (not a forest at all, but a desolate moor).

Apologies that yesterday&rsquo;s blog was missing its first line. Bewildered readers can view the corrected blog on our website here.
Today we recorded what will probably be the fastest 80 mile ride in my life, averaging 21.5mph. Two reasons:

Because we could (more downhill than up and a mostly favourable wind)
Because temperatures were forecast to rise throughout the day, we wanted to get to Riverton (where cowboy hats are de rigueur) before noon, when temperatures were already at 37 and still rising (just hit 39 as I write this at 2.30 after lunch, shower, beer and remedies of a more medical nature

Haha, fooled you. Those of you who were already groaning about another TMI post on the state of our rear ends can relax. I&rsquo;m referring here to Genevieve&rsquo;s rear end, and specifically the rear wheel.
Our own inevitable rear end issues can be fixed, or at least mitigated, by liberal application of chamois cream, sudocrem, butt paste, percutaneous voltarem, or any number of other potions and lotions that we are collectively carrying across America. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Sadly, Genevieve is not so easily cured, although, at least in principle, her rear end is more replaceable than my own.
However, as tandems have to carry twice the weight of normal bikes, they do not use standard wheels (the one we are currently running on has 48 spokes of a heavier than normal gauge). This means that if she has an irreparable problem with her wheels, we cannot simply slap on one of the spares that America By Bicycle carry.... ]]></description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jul 2017 23:02:34 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[ Team GB – The Empire Strikes Back ]]></title><link><![CDATA[ https://www.alineofsight.org.uk/Blog/team-gb-the-empire-strikes-back ]]></link><guid isPermaLink="true"><![CDATA[ https://www.alineofsight.org.uk/Blog/team-gb-the-empire-strikes-back ]]></guid><description><![CDATA[ June 30th, Day 12: Twin Falls, ID to Burley, ID: 39 miles, 1150 ft ascent
In these dangerous Brexit times this wasn&rsquo;t perhaps the most politically sensitive name to choose for our team in today&rsquo;s Scavenger Hunt, so we were particularly heartened to see that the residents of Idaho had, nonetheless, very graciously laid on our very own support vehicle.
&nbsp;
The Scavenger Hunt (aka treasure hunt) was organized by America By Bicycle in the vain hope this might distract us from the headwind, the slight, but monotonous uphill gradient and the incessant traffic noise. The latter being due to most of the ride being on the I84 frontage road (a frontage road is typically the road that the adjacent interstate replaced 50 years ago, and often seems to have not been maintained since that particular humiliation).

Today we rode 97 miles with only 2,000 ft of climbing, although very little downhill as we have finished a fair bit higher than we started and are now at 3,500 ft in Twin Falls, Idaho. This small town has two claims to fame:

It boasts what was once the highest bridge in the world built in 1927 across the Snake River Canyon
This same canyon was the site of Evel Knievel&rsquo;s ill fated but well documented attempt to jump the one mile canyon on a steam powered rocket bike in 1974&nbsp;


But aside from the bridge Alastair hasn&rsquo;t had much visual stuff to describe for me today, so we just pushed on with a pretty brisk ride, getting into Twin Falls just before 1pm.

Our last post mentioned the masochistic element of cycling. Reasoning that a problem shared is a problem halved we thought it would be beneficial to treat our readers to some more detail on the many ailments that affect the long distance cyclist.
Lycra lines are the abrupt transition from bronzed/burned skin to pasty white flesh caused by wearing body hugging shorts day after day in the burning sun. Our cycling clothing is certainly leading to the development of some interesting tanning patterns. Alastair's tan lines in particular are quite well developed.

On our first rest day we are writing this blog outside Bar Gernika in the Basque region of Boise. Temperature in the dappled shade is idyllic and the Maid In The Shade IPA is a rather tasty adult beverage (the American term I am henceforth adopting to describe what we might more prosaically call beer).
If you&rsquo;re ever here check out the hot lamb grinder (a fly-over fusion sandwich, not a dating site for Welsh farmers).
We&rsquo;ve just started a page for photos of our co-riders &ndash; more will be added as we get more good photos and assign some more jocular (read affectionately abusive) nicknames. &nbsp;
To conclude the first segment, here are a couple of great photo's we've not yet had an excuse to post:

Crossing the Idaho/Oregon state line and rolling in to Boise should have been easy, compared to our last 3 days of riding. However, we slightly underestimated the energy sapping effect of 39 C degree heat and were dripping with sweat when we made it into town.
Luckily, Boise has no shortage of restaurants for the hungry cyclist, offering a slightly more sophisticated menu than we have found in 7 days of riding across some of the most deserted parts of America - We could tell we had made it back onto the grid by the easy availability of wagyu beef and "super food" salads containing vegetables we couldn't even &nbsp;identify (in an interesting, good sort of way).
By comparison, our starting point of Ontario, OR, seems to be notable mainly for an overpowering odor of onions in the surrounding rural areas.
It's been a relief to arrive in a modest metropolis for some well deserved rest and recuperation.

After riding 507 miles in 7 days across Oregon, we have just reached the state border with Idaho. We actually followed a pretty direct route, with the shortest possible road route being 464 miles.
For comparison, the shortest road route from the extreme South West tip of England (Lands End) to the Northern border with Scotland (Carlisle) is an almost identical distance at 469 miles. But apart from skirting Portland, we have not encountered any community larger than an English village. This is entirely unsurprising when you realize that:

The population of Oregon is only 7.6% of the population of England
The square mileage of Oregon is almost exactly twice that of England (98,000 vs 50,000).

So, the space that has to be shared by 100 people in England is shared by only 4 people in Oregon.
Anyway, that&rsquo;s a bloody long way of saying it&rsquo;s a bloody long way across Oregon. And we have another 9 state... ]]></description><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jun 2017 22:13:03 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[ Mamils and Diversity of the Species ]]></title><link><![CDATA[ https://www.alineofsight.org.uk/Blog/mamils ]]></link><guid isPermaLink="true"><![CDATA[ https://www.alineofsight.org.uk/Blog/mamils ]]></guid><description><![CDATA[ 24 June, Day 6: John Day, OR to Baker City, OR, 81 miles, 4,650 ft ascent
Firstly it&rsquo;s not strictly true that this is a ride purely for&nbsp;Mamils, as:

We do have some women in the group


Several of the riders would be hard pushed to claim they are still middle aged, even if sixty is the new forty

But the point still stands that the group are (with a couple of exceptions) certainly not spring chickens and are all clad in Lycra on expensive bikes.
So for the first few days Alastair and I have found it quite hard to differentiate and recall who is who.&nbsp;
But as we&rsquo;ve got into the ride it&rsquo;s been fascinating to discover their backgrounds including:

A small squadron of retired pilots
A brace of retired firefighters
A couple of Radiologists
A geologist
A construction business owner.

I promise not to fill this blog with geeky stats about average speed, max speed, calories burned and so forth, but from now on we will put the date, day number, start and end points plus mileage and feet of ascent right at the top of each post.
Having said that, as today was one of the longest on the ride, and we&rsquo;re feeling rather pleased with ourselves after arriving 3rd at the destination hotel, here are some numbers:

115.6 miles (which is 4 more than I have ever done before in a single day, but a breeze for Alastair who recently did a 250 mile Audax)

I recall a journalist friend once bemoaning to me over a beer that her latest submission to her editor had been returned with no annotation other than scrawled at the top &lsquo;Needs to be shorter, snappier and more amusing&rsquo;. One of the other riders on our tour today reported similar (although I&rsquo;m sure rather more diplomatic) feedback from his wife to his posts so far.
I am now somewhat paranoid, so I will at least keep this short by pointing to a YouTube video posted yesterday by Dirk Lohry, another rider on the tour:

At one level we all know that the US is just shed loads bigger than the UK. The population is 4 times bigger and the landmass is more comparable to the whole of Europe than it is to the UK.
But there&rsquo;s something about cycling through the landscape that really brings this home, even though we have only completed 5% of the crossing.
Today&rsquo;s ride started with a 13 mile climb of around 2,800 ft. There are many, many more challenging climbs than this in the US, including lots we will face over the next 7 weeks. This was just acclimatisation. In contrast the longest climb in the UK is generally regarded to be Cragg Vale hill, with an ascent of 968 ft over 5.5 miles while the notoriously steep Bealach-Na-Ba still only climbs 2054 ft over 5.5 miles.&nbsp;

This dictionary definition seems extremely harsh for the end point for today&rsquo;s ride. The residents are just as hospitable and genuine as all the other inhabitants of Oregon that we&rsquo;ve had the pleasure to meet.
Anyway, as a Brit, who am I to make fun of Welches; a recent list&nbsp;of the most amusing UK place names includes Bell End, Scratchy Bottom and Crotch Crescent.&nbsp;
Today we enjoyed our first spell on a dedicated cycle track through the outskirts of Portland, followed by a stunning few miles along South East Bluff Road, where the residents of some rather nice real estate enjoy spectacular distant views of Mount Hood.
&nbsp;
We spent some considerable time speculating why most of the past 2 days prior to this has been on the shoulder of extremely busy 4 lane highways. This has been from necessity as there are simply no other roads to get us from point A to point B.

After yesterday&rsquo;s short 26 mile round trip to the ocean, and 3 hours of briefings, we set off today on the first leg of the Transamerica route. We basically followed the Columbia River reversing the footsteps of the Lewis and Clark Expedition&nbsp;of 1804-1806.

There are around 50 cyclists in the group, almost all American, with Alastair and I forming part of a 5 strong British contingent.
Fact: Oregon is the number 1 US producer of plywood and soft wood lumber. About half of Oregon&rsquo;s 63 million acres is forest and 80% of that is commercially logged.
Empirical observation: Most of the annual production is transported along highway US30 on the 3rd Monday of June.

Countries Visited: 2

 Hours in the saddle: 300
 Miles ridden: 3,653
 Feet of Ascent: 107,200
 Calories burned: 200,000

We contemplated other stats like blisters burst and mils of chamois cream applied but decided that there is indeed a concept of too much information.

We&rsquo;re sitting in our Portland hotel room waiting for breakfast service to begin, and reflecting on yesterday&rsquo;s full 24 hours of travelling from Bath to Portland.&nbsp;So, we just idly googled the distance we&rsquo;d traveled yesterday vs the distance we&rsquo;ll cycle over the next 50 days vs the flight home from Boston on August 9th.

Although yesterday felt never ending it&rsquo;s a bit weird to think that the 6,350 miles we traveled is an awful lot further than we&rsquo;ll travel over the next 50 days. And in fact if we take our entire journey home from here via Astoria, 9 states, 2 countries and a transatlantic flight from Boston, that is only a tad more than we managed in 24 hours yesterday.

By restoring sight we are also restoring independence, mobility and the capacity to work. A massive thank you to everyone whose donations have made this possible.
And today we set off to Astoria, Oregon to begin the&nbsp; ride. Our trusty tandem, Genevieve, &nbsp;has been somehow squeezed into two large bags.

So she&rsquo;s about to board the flight from Heathrow, along with 2&nbsp; spare wheels, a bucket load of potions and more lycra than any self-respecting man should ever wear.
Tomorrow we catch the bus from Portland to Astoria, and my co-rider Alastair faces the challenge of re-creating a functioning tandem from a confusing pile of parts.

Welcome to the website for my 3,600 mile tandem ride across America in summer 2017, raising funds to restore sight to 3,600 cataract sufferers around the world.&nbsp;
Being blind myself, I believe passionately in transforming lives by restoring sight for as many people as we possibly can. My own sight is unlikely to be fixable in my own lifetime as I have a rare hereditary disorder. However, cataracts can be fixed by simple surgical intervention, and I intend to fund 3,600 such interventions, one for each mile that I ride.
We will do this through co-operation with See International on many projects throughout 2017. For more details on See International and the projects we are funding see our Use of Funds page

100% of any donation you make to this fundraising activity will be passed through to SEE International, minus the actual card processing fees (typically less than 2%). SEE International (Surgical Eye Expeditions) is a highly rated US Not for Profit 501C3 organisation.
&nbsp;
SEE will use the funds raised by this ride exclusively for designated surgical clinics in a group of countries with under developed ophthalmic services, including the following projects:
Namibia
Fiji
Cambodia
India
&nbsp;
Through these and similar&nbsp;projects, SEE are able to achieve one intervention for each &pound;30/$40 we raise. They are able to do this due to the amazing generosity of the ophthalmic surgeons from around the world who freely donate their own time and cover their own travel/accommodation costs to operate at the clinics organized by SEE.
&nbsp;

I have been registered blind since the age of 18 and turned 60 in early 2017. Although my condition, degenerative RP, is not treatable, I have been incredibly fortunate to live in the developed world. My education, my career and my personal life have all provided me with immense opportunities in a life that has been filled with pleasure and purpose.
However, most of the&nbsp;39 million blind people in the developing world are not so lucky. Blindness is an isolating and frightening disability with crippling economic impact. The family of someone without sight loses two incomes, one from the blind person themselves and one from the family member who becomes their full time carer.
But the most common cause of sight loss in the world, cataracts, can be cured at a cost of only &pound;30 or $40 per surgical intervention.
I cannot boil the ocean, nor can I save the world, but with your help we will transform 3,600 lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;On June 18th 2017 I am riding a tandem across America fr... ]]></description><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jul 2017 20:30:58 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[ Team Bike – Genevieve ]]></title><link><![CDATA[ https://www.alineofsight.org.uk/FAQs/team-bike-genevieve ]]></link><guid isPermaLink="true"><![CDATA[ https://www.alineofsight.org.uk/FAQs/team-bike-genevieve ]]></guid><description><![CDATA[

James (27) is currently studying for his PhD at the University of Edinburgh on Machine Learning and its application to Music. He&rsquo;ll be the fresh legs taking the front seat on the second half of this epic tour.
His first experience piloting a tandem was with Chris, sleepily navigating the streets of London on the 100km &lsquo;Nightrider&rsquo; in 2013, but he has toured many times (mostly alongside Alastair!). His favourite tour was a 6 day anticlockwise loop of the beautiful Scottish Highlands, from Inverness to Fort William in beautiful sunshine. He caught the cycling bug a decade ago when challenged to cycle from London to Edinburgh whilst raising funds for local charity Chennai Challenge.
Bar cycling, James has also run the London Marathon, swum the Serpentine, and rock climbed in Kalymnos. ]]></description><pubDate>Wed, 24 May 2017 17:45:07 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[ Alastair Heggie ]]></title><link><![CDATA[ https://www.alineofsight.org.uk/FAQs/alastair-heggie ]]></link><guid isPermaLink="true"><![CDATA[ https://www.alineofsight.org.uk/FAQs/alastair-heggie ]]></guid><description><![CDATA[ 
Alastair will be piloting the first half of the tour over the Rockies from Astoria to Sioux Falls.
Alastair inherited a love of cycling from his father (whether he liked it or not).&nbsp;When he was 14 he went on a tour with his family from Gloucestershire to North Wales. Not put off by this experience, Alastair has since toured thought the UK, but this will be his first ride outside this island. On another trip through the mountains of Wales Alastair developed a healthy respect for oncoming vehicles on narrow roads after a fall from his bike. For this reason he is looking forward to the wide roads of America.
Alastair is currently meandering his way through a PhD in Engineering at the University of Edinburgh. In addition to cycling, he is an occasional fell runner, rock climber and sailor. Alastair is a proud member of the Cloud Appreciation Society. ]]></description><pubDate>Wed, 24 May 2017 17:44:59 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[ Chris Mairs ]]></title><link><![CDATA[ https://www.alineofsight.org.uk/FAQs/chris-mairs ]]></link><guid isPermaLink="true"><![CDATA[ https://www.alineofsight.org.uk/FAQs/chris-mairs ]]></guid><description><![CDATA[ 

This ride is Chris&rsquo; pledge to cure 60 people of sight loss a day for 60 consecutive days at the age of 60. Chris suffers from a rare form of degenerative sight loss and was registered blind at the age of 18. He has spent his career as an engineer, business executive and entrepreneur working with digital technology.&nbsp; He&nbsp;is currently a Venture Partner at Entrepreneur First.
In earlier years Chris competed in various sports including captaining the British Disabled Waterski team to victory in 3 world championships.
Chris undertook his first long distance cycle ride in 2012 from Lands End to John o&rsquo;Groats (end to end across the UK) covering 100 miles a day for 10 consecutive days.
In 2014 Chris was awarded a CBE in the New Years Honours list.&nbsp; He is passionate about digital skills education and is a Trustee of the Raspberry Pi Foundation. ]]></description><pubDate>Wed, 24 May 2017 17:44:39 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[ Story/testimonial tips ]]></title><link><![CDATA[ https://www.alineofsight.org.uk/story-1 ]]></link><guid isPermaLink="true"><![CDATA[ https://www.alineofsight.org.uk/story-1 ]]></guid><description><![CDATA[ &lt;Images and videos can really bring case studies to life&gt;
Telling the story
The story is most effective when told from the point of the view of the beneficiary. A direct narrative from someone whose life has changed will be compelling and inspiring.&nbsp;Your impact will be clear, real and engaging. The story should have three key parts:

The case study's initial situation&nbsp;and&nbsp;challenges
What happened to change things
Where they are&nbsp;now as a result. This&nbsp;might include new hopes for the future

Grab the reader
You&nbsp;need to get the reader's attention in the first sentence/paragraph; background info can come in&nbsp;later if necessary. Make your readers want to&nbsp;read on to find out what happened / the full story, using, for example:

emotion
intrigue
shock
surprise

Keep it real / unique
Small, real-life details make a big&nbsp;difference in ensuring&nbsp;your case study stands out as an&nbsp;individual and remains in the memory.
