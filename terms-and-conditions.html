<h3><a href="Blog/eddington-numbers-and-extraordinary-cycling-records.html">Eddington Numbers and Extraordinary Cycling Records</a></h3>
<p>July 21st, Day 33: The last 50 miles of today’s ride was in the sort of constant rain that makes one think of England (not necessarily in a homesick sort of way). But at least it wasn’t cold and the winds weren’t fierce.</p>
